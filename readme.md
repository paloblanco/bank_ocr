# Bank OCR

Working the following kata: https://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/

To play in this repo, just create a virtual environment in the root, then 
```
python -m pip install pytest
```
Don't use the requirements.txt right now, Rocco borked his system python by pip installing to the global install. Boo!
